# pb-dashboard

The purpose of this repository is to provide access to the source code for a dashboard of police brutality cases in the US.

The dashboard provides a real-time view into police brutality across the United States. Furthermore, the dashboard is integrated with a form. The form allows people to report instances of police brutality. Those instances of police brutality then get reflected in the dashboard. We understand that self-reported data may not always be reliable. Therefore, we are requiring users to submit their reports with images or videos, for proof. If the community has recommendations on other ways to maintain data integrity, please let us know.

Our first iteration of the dashboard was scrappy. We used a mix of Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Tableau Public, to ship this first prototype here-> https://public.tableau.com/profile/kamran2555#!/vizhome/shared/937995TNC

This repo is a living version of the dashboard, as it evolves into an independent application of its own.
